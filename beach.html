		<p class="origin_paragraph"> <strong>Origin</strong> <br> Cruisers were popular throughout the 1930s and 40s and gained greater postwar success. Their combination of substantial weight and wide tires made the bicycles popular among paperboys.</p>

	<section class="cruiser_section2">
		<p class="type_paragraph"> <strong>Types</strong> <br> Cruisers are popular among casual bicyclists and vacationers because they are very stable and easy to ride, but their heavy weight and balloon tires tend to make them rather slow. They are designed for use primarily on paved roads, moderate speeds/distances, and are included in the non-racing/non-touring class and heavyweight or middleweight styles of the road bicycle type.</p>

		<p class="skill_paragraph"> <strong>Skill</strong> <br> Cruisers' comfort, style, and affordability (compared to mountain and racing bikes) have led to renewed popularity in recent years. In the 1980s Huffy built the "Good Vibrations" beach cruiser, and Murray built the "Monterey" beach cruiser, both using product names, like beaches, with an association to the west coast of California. </p>
